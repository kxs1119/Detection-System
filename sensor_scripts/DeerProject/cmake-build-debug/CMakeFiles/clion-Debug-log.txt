CMake Deprecation Warning at lib/pigpio-master/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/clion-2024.2.3/bin/cmake/linux/aarch64/share/cmake-3.29/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (rt) does
  not match the name of the calling package (RT).  This can lead to problems
  in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables (e.g.,
  `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  lib/pigpio-master/cmake/FindRT.cmake:28 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  lib/pigpio-master/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
